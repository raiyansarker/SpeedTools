### Why you might need it  
This was made under a fun project. I wanted to test out whether I remembered python and at the same time my school studies. Then I found why not I merge them together and test out both at the same time!  
And then I made this project. It took a few hours and I remembered both. You can also try this tool or get inspiration or take it as an example!
